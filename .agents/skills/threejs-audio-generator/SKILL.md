# Three.js Audio Generator

## Purpose

Create game-ready audio assets for Three.js projects. This skill consolidates game sound generation, voice generation/conversion, audio cleanup, credential probing, and runtime integration into one Three.js-focused production workflow.

Provider: ElevenLabs.

Run this skill only when the active GDD names an audio asset that procedural or
recorded project audio cannot cover. Probe ElevenLabs only after selection and
record outputs or the blocker directly in the GDD.

Resolve `<this-skill-dir>` in the commands below in this order: `~/.claude/skills/threejs-audio-generator`, `~/.codex/skills/threejs-audio-generator`, `~/.agents/skills/threejs-audio-generator`, or repo `skills/threejs-audio-generator`.

## When To Use

Use this skill for:

- SFX: jumps, hits, weapons, explosions, coins, pickups, collisions, UI clicks, confirms, errors.
- Ambience: wind, rain, city bed, engine hum, portal loop, dungeon room tone, battle arena beds.
- Voice: announcer barks, boss lines, tutorial prompts, menu narration, generated placeholder dialogue.
- Voice conversion: convert a scratch performance into a target character voice while preserving timing and emotion.
- Cleanup: isolate or denoise dialogue before voice conversion, TTS replacement, or transcription.
- Three.js integration: Web Audio loading, looping, sprite/manifest mapping, volume groups, pause/resume, user gesture unlock.

Polish wording alone never mandates generated audio; the approved scope still
needs an explicit ambience/SFX/voice decision or blocker.

## API Key

Never store API keys in skill files or browser/game code, and never paste a key value into a report. The script reads `--api-key` or `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`.

Step 0, before declaring the key unavailable: run this skill's own probe and paste its literal output into the report.

```bash
python3 <this-skill-dir>/scripts/threejs_audio_asset.py probe   # prints ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=SET|MISSING
```

`ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=MISSING` is only a valid blocker after this selected skill's
probe. Keys defined only in a shell profile can be absent from the process env;
if the plain probe prints MISSING unexpectedly, wrap it:
`zsh -lc 'source ~/.zprofile 2>/dev/null || true; source ~/.zshrc 2>/dev/null || true; python3 <this-skill-dir>/scripts/threejs_audio_asset.py probe'`.

Audio-specific: add `--validate` to the probe to call ElevenLabs `GET /user` and confirm the key actually works (prints `VALID_USER=...`); use it when a key is present but a generation still fails. A valid key can still be blocked by an out-of-credit or plan-tier limit — those surface as an `HTTP 4xx` from a real generation attempt. Report that as a purchase/plan blocker, do not silently skip.

## Required Reference

Load `references/audio-workflows.md` before building a game audio plan, generating multiple assets, wiring runtime audio, cleaning/converting voices, or claiming premium game audio.

Record the selected reference directly in the active GDD; do not create a
separate reference ledger.

## Tool Script

Run from the user's current game project directory:

```bash
python3 <this-skill-dir>/scripts/threejs_audio_asset.py --help
```

Probe:

```bash
python3 <this-skill-dir>/scripts/threejs_audio_asset.py probe
```

Generate SFX:

```bash
python3 <this-skill-dir>/scripts/threejs_audio_asset.py sfx \
  --prompt "tight futuristic boost pickup, bright transient, short sparkling tail, arcade racing game" \
  --duration 1.2 \
  --prompt-influence 0.65 \
  --out assets/audio/sfx/boost-pickup.mp3
```

Generate looping ambience:

```bash
python3 <this-skill-dir>/scripts/threejs_audio_asset.py sfx \
  --prompt "seamless cyber resort mini golf ambience, distant surf, soft neon transformer hum, gentle crowd bed" \
  --duration 12 \
  --loop \
  --prompt-influence 0.45 \
  --out assets/audio/ambience/cyber-resort-loop.mp3
```

Generate TTS/announcer line:

```bash
python3 <this-skill-dir>/scripts/threejs_audio_asset.py tts \
  --text "Perfect shot." \
  --voice-id JBFqnCBsd6RMkjVDRZzb \
  --out assets/audio/voice/perfect-shot.mp3
```

Clean dialogue:

```bash
python3 <this-skill-dir>/scripts/threejs_audio_asset.py isolate \
  --input assets/audio/source/noisy-boss-line.wav \
  --out assets/audio/voice/boss-line-clean.mp3
```

Convert a scratch performance to a target voice:

```bash
python3 <this-skill-dir>/scripts/threejs_audio_asset.py voice-change \
  --input assets/audio/source/scratch-boss-line.wav \
  --voice-id JBFqnCBsd6RMkjVDRZzb \
  --remove-background-noise \
  --out assets/audio/voice/boss-line-final.mp3
```

## Game Audio Defaults

- SFX: `mp3_44100_128`, 0.5-2.5s, prompt influence `0.55-0.8`.
- UI: 0.15-0.8s, high prompt influence, keep transients clear.
- Ambience loops: 8-30s, `--loop`, prompt influence `0.3-0.55`.
- Voice: TTS for clean generated lines; voice-change when timing/acting from a scratch performance matters.
- Cleanup: isolate noisy speech before voice-change or final dialogue use.
- Runtime: generate locally, commit/import files, and load them via Web Audio/Three.js integration. Never put API keys in browser code.

## Required Report

Report:

- Credential probe output or real blocker.
- Selected reference path.
- Generated/processed file paths.
- Prompts/text/input files, voice IDs, durations, loop flags, and output formats.
- Runtime integration notes: audio groups, trigger events, loop behavior, unlock gesture, pause/resume, volume/mute controls.
- Remaining audio gaps and any licensing/plan assumptions tied to the user's ElevenLabs account.
