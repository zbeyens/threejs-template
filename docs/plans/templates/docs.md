Objective:
TODO: Write the short create_goal objective, under 240 characters. Put the full docs contract in the sections below.

Goal plan:
{{PLAN_PATH}}

Template:
{{TEMPLATE_PATH}}

Docs source:
- type: pending
- id / link: pending
- title: pending
- acceptance criteria: pending

Docs lane:
- lane: pending
- target docs: pending
- documented source owner: pending
- nearest sibling docs: pending
- product/API owner: pending

Timed checkpoint:
- requested duration: pending
- semantics: pending
- initial confidence score: pending
- improvement loop: pending
- final score / loop closure: pending

Completion threshold:
- TODO: Define the exact docs done state.
- Docs closure is legal only when the page teaches the fastest correct path,
  every claim is source-backed, docs-lane shape is satisfied, required MDX/link/
  preview checks are recorded, and
  `node .agents/skills/autogoal/scripts/check-complete.mjs {{PLAN_PATH}}`
  passes.

Verification surface:
- TODO: Name the source audit, docs render/parser command, link/demo check,
  content build, or review proof that proves the threshold.

Constraints:
- Follow the nearest existing docs style and any user-named docs guidance.
- Write current-state docs only. No changelog voice.
- Keep code examples repo-backed and copy-pasteable.
- Do not invent APIs, routes, demos, imports, components, transforms, or options.
- Do not add docs ceremony for tiny typo/copy edits.

Boundaries:
- Source of truth: TODO.
- Allowed edit scope: TODO.
- Browser surface: TODO.
- GitHub sync: TODO.
- Non-goals: TODO.

Blocked condition:
- TODO: Name the missing source code, docs entry, demo, route, design
  decision, product choice, or command failure that stops autonomous docs work.

Docs state:
- task_type: docs
- task_complexity: pending
- current_phase: intake
- current_phase_status: in_progress
- next_phase: writing
- goal_status: active

Current verdict:
- verdict: pending
- confidence: pending
- next owner: docs
- reason: pending

Completion rule:
- Do not call `update_goal(status: complete)` while any required checklist item
  remains unchecked. If an item does not apply, check it and add `N/A: <reason>`.
- Do not call `update_goal(status: complete)` until every completion threshold
  above is satisfied, final evidence is recorded, and
  `node .agents/skills/autogoal/scripts/check-complete.mjs {{PLAN_PATH}}`
  passes.
- Do not create hook state for this goal. This file plus the active goal are the
  durable state.

Work Checklist:
- [ ] If a duration was requested, it is recorded as minimum active work unless
      explicitly marked hard stop; when no better metric exists, initial and
      final confidence scores are recorded.
- [ ] Objective includes outcome, completion threshold, verification surface,
      constraints, boundaries, and blocked condition.
- [ ] Docs lane is classified as install, guide/system, plugin/feature,
      serialization/conversion, workflow/AI, API reference, or spec/law.
- [ ] Target docs and nearest sibling docs were read before writing.
- [ ] Nearest docs style or user-named docs guidance was read before writing.
- [ ] Documented behavior or API was verified against current source.
- [ ] Ownership map records route, service, API, package, app-local, and docs
      ownership where relevant.
- [ ] Fastest success path appears before deeper mechanics or API reference.
- [ ] Opening is three sentences or fewer and avoids generic fluff.
- [ ] Named APIs, options, transforms, components, imports, routes, and package
      specifiers are exact and current.
- [ ] Feature/API docs, if applicable, satisfy source ownership and current
      runtime behavior.
- [ ] Serialization docs, if applicable, split directions and state environment
      constraints before examples.
- [ ] API reference docs, if applicable, use exact contracts and avoid tutorial
      filler.
- [ ] Spec/law docs, if applicable, record owner map, evidence, and explicit
      gaps.
- [ ] Demos/previews/examples are real source-backed surfaces or marked N/A
      with reason.
- [ ] Links target real leaf pages and do not reinforce pages being displaced.
- [ ] Anti-slop audit passed: no changelog voice, no fake APIs, no placeholder
      comments, no TODOs, no dead anchors, no redundant summary section.
- [ ] Workspace authority recorded: every proof command names the cwd/tool that
      owns the changed docs.
- [ ] Review/autoreview target selected for non-trivial docs work, or marked
      N/A with reason.

Completion Gates:
| Gate | Applies | Required action | Evidence |
|------|---------|-----------------|----------|

| Ownership map verified | pending | Confirm route/service/API/package/app-local ownership claims against source | pending |
| MDX/content parser | pending | Run the relevant docs parser/build for MDX/content changes, or record N/A | pending |
| Links/routes/previews verified | pending | Check leaf links, routes, anchors, and `<ComponentPreview>` names or record N/A | pending |
| Browser/render surface changed | pending | Capture Browser Use proof or record explicit waiver/blocker | pending |
